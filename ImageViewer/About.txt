Notes on Operation:
- User should not move files around manually or rename images manually between or
during program sessions.
- The Sorting feature sorts within each Directory, and the ordering of Directories is kept the same.
- Image names on the Images tab are displayed with the name of the directory it is in for
organizational purposes.
- Selecting a directory will show all Images inside and within any sub-directories recursively.
- Two Images cannot have the same name(without tags) within the same root directory in order to
prevent IOExceptions and files being overwritten.
- Unused Tags are cleared from the Global Tag list on program close to reduce clutter.
- All paths shown in the GUI are full(absolute) paths.
- Non-Image files are not filtered out and can be used in the program, however no image-preview will
be shown for these.

Notes on GUI usage:
- To start, click File -> Add Directory and select a Directory on the computer.
- Any Directory added to the program will have it's sub-directories added to the Directories tab as well.
- The program will automatically scan all files in the Directory and detect any Tags that need to
be added to the program.
- Multiple Tags can be selected to be applied to an Image by holding CTRL when selecting Tags.
- A larger scale preview of the currently selected Image can be found under "Full Image Preview".


Notes on moving an Image between Directories:
- When asked to input the name of an image, input the name without tags.
- Full path of a directory is required for moving an image to it.

- For example if i want to move GRUMPYCAT from C:\Users\b2_al\group_0518\phase2\images\cats
to C:\Users\b2_al\group_0518\phase2\images\dogs:

Start directory = C:\Users\b2_al\group_0518\phase2\images\cats

End directory = C:\Users\b2_al\group_0518\phase2\images\dogs

Image Name = GRUMPYCAT.

Once you move an image, close the window to see changes.
